# DaoProposalSingleInstant

This is the proposal module adapter for the
[`dao-proposal-single`](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/tree/main/contracts/proposal/dao-proposal-single)
contract, which powers single choice proposals. It supports `Yes`, `No`, and
`Abstain` votes, and a passing proposal may execute a set of actions on behalf
of the DAO.
